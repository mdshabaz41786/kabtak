            <h3> In my Mother’s life story, I see the penance,
sacrifice and contribution of India’s
matrushakti: PM Modi </h3>
            <p>In June this year, PM wrote a blog on the occasion of his mother’s birthday,
paying tribute to her remarkable life and indomitable spirit. Excerpts:
Mother is not just any other word in the dictionary. It encompasses a whole range of
emotions -- love, patience, trust, and a lot more. Across the world, irrespective of country
or region, children have a special affection for their mothers. A mother not only gives birth
to her children, but also shapes their mind, their personality, and their self confidence. And
while doing so, mothers selflessly sacrifice their own personal needs and aspirations.  </p>

     <p> My Mother is as simple as she is extraordinary. Just like all mothers! As I write about my
Mother, I am sure that many of you would relate to my description of her. While reading,
you may even see your own mother’s image. My Mother was born in Visnagar in Mehsana
in Gujarat, which is quite close to my hometown Vadnagar. She did not get her own
mother’s affection. At a tender age, she lost my grandmother to the Spanish Flu pandemic.
She does not even remember my grandmother’s face or the comfort of her lap. She spent
her entire childhood without her mother. She could not even go to school and learn to read
and write. Her childhood was one of poverty and deprivation. </p>

            <p>  While India formally assumed the G20 Presidency on December 1, it took over the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on September 16. </p>
            <img src="image/Russian-President-Vladimir-Putin-AFP-_1672423664584_.jpg">
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday voiced confidence that India’s presidencies of the SCO and G20 will build multi-dimensional cooperation between the two countries and will strengthen the stability and security in Asia and the entire world.</p>
            <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-8484299510078894"

            <p>While India formally assumed the G20 Presidency on December 1, it took over the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on September 16.

In his New Year messages to President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Putin noted that Russia and India marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations in 2022 and, relying on positive traditions of friendship and mutual respect, the countries continue to develop their specially privileged strategic partnership, the Kremlin said in a statement.

Putin said the two countries carried out large-scale trade and economic projects in addition to energy, military technology and other areas of cooperation, and coordinated efforts in addressing important matters of regional and global agendas.

“I am confident that India’s recently started SCO and G20 presidencies will open new opportunities for building multi-dimensional Russia-India cooperation for the benefit of our peoples, in the interests of strengthening stability and security in Asia and the entire world,” he said. </p>

India and Saudi Arabia are in talks to sign a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) to obtain formal assistance from each other in investigations related to criminal cases.

Saudi Arabia is only among a dozen other countries that does not have either an MLAT or any other bilateral agreement with India to facilitate such investigations. India has so far signed MLATs with 45 countries, and is also in talks to finalise MLATs with Italy and Germany.

According to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), an MLAT is “a mechanism whereby countries cooperate with one another in order to provide and obtain formal assistance in prevention, suppression, investigation and prosecution of crime to ensure that the criminals do not escape or sabotage the due process of law for want of evidence available in different countries.”
Officials in Saudi Arabia and India have now initiated discussions to sign the treaty. On November 7, India held the first virtual negotiation meeting with Saudi Arabia. The Indian delegation was led by officials from the MHA, the Ministry of External Affairs, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Law Ministry.
